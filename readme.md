# Police Shootins
## Intro

First, I pulled this dataset from Kaggle at the following web address:
https://www.kaggle.com/washingtonpost/police-shootings
The Washington Post, I believe, is the group that gathered all of this data.

As usual this is another project to improve my skills with Pandas. However,
having a history and political science background, I am very interested in
social issues and decided to look at some data in regards to a hot topic today
which is police shootings. I will also say, that when I was in the Marines,
I developed a deep interest in insurgencies and counter insurgency techniques.
One of the lessons that I learned in fighting an insurgency is to actually not
use force but to build an excellent relationship with the people. During my time
in Iraq, we also had very strict rules of engagement placed on us. Thus, I am
interested in police shootings and would like to see how the data, for 2015, looks.
Essentially, I think that this is a good project to better my developer skills
as well as apply my love of social issues.
